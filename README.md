CountVectorizer
This converts the text into pieces called “tokens” based on the frequencies. it is gives a sparse matric i.e, a matrix with numbers (0,1,2,…etc) as elements. 0 represents that the word did not appear. 1 represents that the word appeared once in the line of text in this manner we have to understand the frequency by observing this matrix one can understand how many times each word is repeated.
